# Ask me anything!

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

I don't get any questions by email, or really at all, but this will be fun if I ever make friends who also code.

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite :)
